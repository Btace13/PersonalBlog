## Scare Factor
I have to start off by saying that im not a huge fan of what the horror genera has become over the years. The constant jump scares the unnecessary loud noises and music is usually enough to make me think twice about seeing a new horror movie, but I have to say this movie was a very refreshing break from all that. There wasn't many useless jump scares and the music went very well with each scare. They actually made Pennywise very creepy and not something they just flash in your face to make you jump. Everything from the way he talks to the way he looks at you was done very well. It was tough to look into his face for more than a few seconds. So when it comes to being a horror movie this movie did its job very well.

## The Acting
It's always a hit or miss when it comes to child actors, but the cast of this film was fucking awesome. Finn Wolfhard killed it. If there was a character that carried the film; it was him. Not that the film needed to be carried. Finn's character played as the comic relief, and boy was he. I don't think he said one joke that was unatural. He had the entire theatre laughing. Wyatt Oleff's character was the only one that i had a problem with, he never seemed part of the group. He was always the one standing outside the group and was just there. It was a little awkward at times but he didn't play a huge part in the movie so it wasn't a big deal. Other than his character the cast meshed really well together. You could tell that they were having fun which made their adventure that much more enjoyable.

## The Story
The pace of the story was great. Though the film was a bit on the long side, you can't really feel it. Not only where they able to establish back stories for all the characters but the timing of each back story was well executed. They didn't let it interrupt the story's pace. The motive of Pennywise was explained well and the motives of the characters were understandable. The way Pennywise played on each of the character's fears was creative and fun, in a scary way. They decided to make the IT story into two movies which allowed them to flesh out each character and tell a more well rounded story instead of cramming everything into one movie. If you're not familiar with the original movie, they end up having to go back to the town haunted by Pennywise as adults and beat him for good. I'm excited to see the cast for that movie and how they execute that story. So overall the story takes you on a crazy ride following kids trying to kill a murderous clown, and they have you laughing and screaming the entire time.

## Should you go watch it?
If you are deathly afraid of clowns then maybe skip this film, but if you're looking for a refreshing new kind of horror movie that takes you for a great ride, then this would be a great movie to see. definitely go out to the theatre and see this film. If you're a huge fan of the original then you won't be disappointed, if you've never heard of IT, you still won't be disappointed. Take a date, or a few friends and have a good time. 

## Rating: 7/10
