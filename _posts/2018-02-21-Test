#This is awesome
 > wow
 I have to start off by saying that im not a huge fan of what the horror genre has become over the years. The constant jump scares the unnecessary loud noises and music is usually enough to make me think twice about seeing a new horror movie, but I have to say this movie was a very refreshing break from all that. There wasn’t many useless jump scares and the music went very well with each scare. They actually made Pennywise very creepy and not something they just flash in your face to make you jump. Everything from the way he talks to the way he looks was done very well. It was tough looking at his face for more than a few seconds. So when it comes to being a horror movie it did its job very well.
